# OpenGL-House
A school project in GLUT

The Goal was to create a house on a flat grass plane. A sun must revolve around the plane. When the sun sets, it must
immediately rise again, without going all the way around. When the sun is rising or setting, it must not be as bright.
The user can turn the camera with Q and E, and can also move around with WASD.
There is also a menu on right click with graphics options, as well as the option to quit.

The exe file is in the Debug folder.
You must also download freeglut in order to run the exe.
